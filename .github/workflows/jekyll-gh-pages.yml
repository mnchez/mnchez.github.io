They killed Newcastle when he couldn’t pay, unaware that Lamont was watching.

His parents did not; they loved him unconditionally because they saw the true empathic, creative soul of their son.

But over time, with each victory, the power inside him grew, and with it, his strength in the Arena. And as his reputation began to precede him, a strange thing happened… The people in the crowd who were downtrodden, outcast, and forgotten—they saw themselves in Seer. Soon, throngs of people would come out just to see him fight—cheering Seer on as their champion. Now, this legend from the Arenas is making his way to the Apex Games and there isn’t a single soul who hasn’t already heard his name. The boy born under a bad omen and a terrible myth has taken this tale and created an even greater legend. He is Seer— an icon of the shunned, the unaccepted, and the unabashedly original.</p>",

Well, that, and the Apex Games card she took from Blisk’s grasp.</p><p>Using the intact flight core from Viper’s Northstar, she built a sleek new jetpack that honored her father’s memory.

The tight-lipped Xenia could only get her chatty daughter to stop asking questions by giving her a scavenged copy of Encyclopedia Outlandica, which Mara memorized front to back.</p><p>When Mara was 18, she discovered the wreck of the G.D.S. Vantage. Against her mother’s wishes, Mara snuck in, only to learn that she had been lied to. Her mother hadn’t grown up on Págos: she was brought there on the G.D.S. Vantage as a prisoner. Disturbed by the intrusion, the ship collapsed into a crevasse, trapping a wounded Mara. Her mother only found her after a baby bat Mara had rescued circled the crevasse holding Mara’s signature whistle. By the time Xenia got to her daughter, the injuries were too severe for her to treat.To save her daughter’s life, Xenia set off the prison ship’s SOS beacon, but was imprisoned once more in return.</p><p>Once Mara had healed, she visited her mother in jail, promising to find a way to get her out. But Xenia begged Mara not to, fearful that Mara would wind up in prison beside her. It would break her heart to see her daughter share her fate, so Xenia told her daughter to get back to Págos and forget about her.</p><p>But Mara would not. At a loss for what to do, unable to return to her planet, and unable to fit into society, Mara’s eye turned to the Apex Games. In it, she saw a situation she understood--survival--and a platform to draw public attention to Xenia’s case. With raised awareness of her wrongful conviction, she took the moniker Vantage to rally support and pressure those in power to set her mother free.</p>",
